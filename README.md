# gtrendExample

This shiny app returns search trends pertaining to the search term "ISIS". User input alters the observable search time period. 

Copying the files into a local working directory should work, just make sure to enter your own Google username and password into `gconnect()` function found in the `server.R` file.

Once you have inserted your Google log-in information, you can run the app in the current working directory by executing `runApp()` in the console or by clicking on "Run App" in the top-right of the file window if you are working in Rstudio.
